# react-photogram
instagram kinda thing built in React



- okay, theres a very strange (I think) bug here.
  - I could have sworn in the previous build I had to add "../../" to the images for them to render.
  - but now they don't?
  - I thought it was weird at the time, that it didn't automatically recognize the public folder.
  - I wonder if its from installing npm rather than create-react-app?
